    Welcome to your machine learning playground. <br>
    In the following steps you are able to build your own convolutional neural network, train it and test it. <br>
    Click on the different parts to show an info text explaining what it will do. <br>
    For starters, please choose how many blocks you want to implement in your model. <br>

                    Linear layers make up the final layers in neural networks for classification. As input, they take a vector which in a CNN is a flattened matrix from the previous layer. While data passes through the network, the linear layers perform a linear transformation by multiplying each input neuron by a weight and adding a bias. Several of these layers can be connected sequentially to reduce the number of inputs. Finally, the output consists of a neuron for each class and a corresponding probability determining how likely the input belongs to each class.

                    Activations functions play a critical in neural networks as they add nonlinearity to the models hidden layers. This is necessary as it allows for more complex functions inside the model that can also capture nonlinear relationships. Typically, the same activation function is chosen for the entire network.
