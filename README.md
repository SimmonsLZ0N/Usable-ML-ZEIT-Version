# Usable-Machine-Learning-
Training Interface

*start training
*interrupt training
*continue training

*adjust parameters (e.g., learning rate, loss function, momentum, dropout-rate) (0.5 P)

*before the training
*during the training


revert to an earlier epoch (1 P)
freeze parts of the model (1 P)



Training Monitor

*display accuracy and loss over time for training set
*indicate point in training where a parameter was changed
display accuracy and loss over time for test set (0.5 P)
display layer-specific information (e.g., gradients) (1 - 2 P)
compare different runs (1 P)
fork graph when parameters of earlier epochs are changed (1.5 P)


Model Creator

create models using a GUI (2 P)
change the composition of layers (1 P)
change aspects of the layers (e.g., sizes) (0.5 P)


Model Evaluator

select stored model to be evaluated (0.5 P)
evaluate per-class accuracy on test set (or training set, or arbitrary dataset) (1 P)
display special examples which (2 P)

are falsely predicted
are predicted with a small loss





Items in bold are expected as a minimum feature set.
